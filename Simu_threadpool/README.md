# Codes for simulation using Threadpool

Start from ThreadPool_RL.cpp 

I've migrate the definition of all tunable hyperparameters to the beginning of main(), Papon please help with merging them into system arguments and check whether I missed anything.

Meanwhile, there are several things still missing in the script, let me make a remark here:
1. we need a counter for current occupying threads in each pool (via auto), Papon please help with this;
2. rewards are not well-defined yet, one idea is to use the frequecnies of pages involved in migration, need to explore more;
3. maintaining the list_num_req and list_idle is cost significant, see if there's alternative way to do so;
4. temperature model is based on previos experiences, check if modifications are needed;
5. RL hyperparamters.
