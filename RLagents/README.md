**RL_Agent.h** defines the head file of RL agent class. It contains parameters of the value function, and functions names act(), cost_phi(), and learn(). act() outputs action option for a given states; cost_phi() calculate the values of value function and phis in the value function; learn() is used to update agent's parameters.

**RL_cost_phi.cpp** is a toy script to show how each function in RL_Agent can be used.
